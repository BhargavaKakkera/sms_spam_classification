## SMS Spam Classification using ML Models and Neural Networks

This project classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using a combination of **Machine Learning models** and a **Neural Network**.

## 🧠 Overview

The goal is to detect spam messages from text data efficiently.  
The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** for ML models  
- Tokenization and padding for the **Neural Network**  
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison  

The deep learning model was trained and evaluated in **Google Colab** (notebook).

## ⚙️ Features
- Text preprocessing (punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming)  
- Multiple ML model comparisons — Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Linear SVM  
- Deep Learning model (Feedforward Neural Network) built using **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
- Saved models and vectorizers for local prediction
